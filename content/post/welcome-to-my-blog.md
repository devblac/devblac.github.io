# Welcome to My Blog!

Hey, I’m Julián — and this is my digital garden.  
Some parts are tidy rows of code. Others are wild, overgrown tangles of thought.

This space is for building out loud — a slow unraveling of the things I’m learning, making, questioning, and occasionally breaking on purpose. Expect a blend of technical writing, philosophical tangents, odd metaphors, and moments of clarity that only came after a long walk (or a long bug hunt).

## What You’ll Find Here

### 🧭 Learning Logs  
Step-by-step guides, useful tools, lessons from real projects — shared with honesty and humor.  
If it helped me, confused me, or changed how I think, I’ll likely write about it.

### 🌀 Thought Spirals  
Reflections that connect code with culture, systems with society, bugs with human behavior.  
Sometimes things click when you look sideways.

### 🛠️ Project Spotlights  
I’ll occasionally open the hood on what I’m building — from a blockchain-based housing platform (still a sketch on the napkin of my mind) to apps that try to do something kind, or at least meaningful.

## Why I Started This

Because knowledge multiplies when shared.  
Because I think better when I write.  
Because not everything needs to be finished to be valuable.

And because one of the people I love the most — my best friend Mariano — gave me the gentle nudge I needed to stop overthinking and start writing. This blog wouldn’t exist without his push, his faith, and his deep knowing of who I am. Gracias, amigo.

## A Bit About Me

- I’m a senior software engineer who’s equally excited about ethics and edge cases.
- I believe software is more than syntax — it’s a medium for shaping how we live.
- I tend to relate everything with everything. A bug in code might remind me of a fern unraveling.
- I once built a CLI version of Truco just to play with a friend. Bash and `curl` were invited.
- I’m better at naming variables than plants — but I love both.

<summary>🪄 Curious minds dig deeper</summary>

I’m working on a project to make housing more accessible without debt.  
It’s early, it’s idealistic, and it might take a village — or a protocol.  
But what is code for, if not imagining new ways to belong?
